# Overview
The 27th HIPS workshop, proposed as a full-day meeting at the IEEE IPDPS 2022
conference in Lyon, France and as virtual workshop, focuses on high-level
programming of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel
machines. Like previous workshops in the series, which was established in 1996,
this event will serve as a forum for research in the areas of parallel
applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming
tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the
latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for
papers, we especially encouraged innovative approaches in the areas of emerging
programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core
architectures.

# Important Deadlines
Submission due date: Early January 2022
Author notification: Mid February 2022
Camera-ready papers: End of February 2022

# Submission
The HIPS paper style is identical to the IPDPS paper style.

Submitted manuscripts may not exceed 10 single-spaced double-column pages using
10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including
figures, tables, and references.

- Compiler analysis and optimization techniques
- OS and architectural support for parallel programming and debugging
- Software and system support for extreme scalability including fault tolerance and power-aware HPC
- Programming environments for heterogeneous multicore systems and accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs
- Solutions for programming paradigms for GPUs from different hardware vendors
- Dynamism in applications and system resources
- Performance portability
- Efforts for improving the sustainability of scientific software 
- Languages and runtime support for multi-science/coupled codes, including but not limited to ensemble computing and uncertainty quantification
- New programming languages and constructs for exploiting parallelism and locality
- Higher-level programming models or languages for quan- tum computing/quantum simulation
- Efforts in programming models, environments, and ex- perience on emerging computer architectures, such as Cerebras, SambaNova, ARM, etc.
