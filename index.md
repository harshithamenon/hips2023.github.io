# Overview
The 27th HIPS workshop, proposed as a full-day meeting at the IEEE IPDPS 2022
conference in Lyon, France and as virtual workshop, focuses on high-level
programming of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel
machines. Like previous workshops in the series, which was established in 1996,
this event will serve as a forum for research in the areas of parallel
applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming
tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the
latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for
papers, we especially encouraged innovative approaches in the areas of emerging
programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core
architectures.
