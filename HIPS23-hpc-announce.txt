workshop series is to provide attendees with a focused and in-depth
platform for presentations, discussion and interaction in a
particular subject area.

to all aspects of research, development, and application of
high-performance systems with a focus on high-level programming of
multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines.
